Each of the three chapters of this dissertation is based on an empirical research paper.  While the topic of each chapter is different, they are linked by methodology.  Each chapter develops a structural model of economic interaction, applies econometric techniques to estimate model parameters from data, and then uses the estimated model to analyze policy questions.

In the first chapter, I modify a recent theoretical model of conspicuous consumption to empirically measure the the importance of peer beliefs to Americans and Chinese.  Estimating the model on household budget surveys, I find that Chinese consumers care 20\% more than American consumers about peer  beliefs.  I use the estimated model to evaluate the welfare effect of the 1990-2002 American luxury tax on automobiles.  The luxury tax benefitted nearly all Americans a small amount, but hurt the small fraction of consumers who love automobiles the most.\end{abstract}
