\newthought{No graduate student} is an island.  I am deeply indebted to my adviser Jim Tybout for patience with my terrible whiteboard handwriting in countless meetings, for both giving me excellent advice and the freedom to make my own decisions, and for support of many kinds.  Straight is the gate and narrow is the way through graduate school, and I was lucky to have Jim as a guide.\\

I am grateful to Jonathan Eaton for his thorough comments on everything from barely coherent research notes up to my polished job-market paper, for his guidance in choosing a research topic, and for his advice and training over the last five years.\\

My understanding of economic research was tempered in the oven that is Kern 6th floor and tested over pitchers of beer at Cafe 210 West with my friends and colleagues Yu Awaya, Xue Bai, Chun-Ting Chen, Mohammad Davoodalhoseini, Bernardo Diaz, Pelin Dogruer, Alex Fakos, Farid Farrokhi, Bulat Gafarov, Gustavo Gudino, Yoske Igarashi, Konstantin Kucheryavyy, Ahmad Lashkaripour, Joosung Lee, Shengyu Li, Jicheng Liu, Gary Lyn, Wataru Nozawa, Bruno Salcedo, Yelena Sheveleva, Wiroy Shin, Bruno Sultanum, Felix Tintelnot, Marlon Williams, Hoon Sik Yang, and many others.\\

My parents Mark and Ann Jinkins were generous enough to continue calling me even after repeatedly suffering through fumbling descriptions of my \emph{next} great idea.  I hope they know how seriously I take their advice, and how they have shaped my life.\\

I am grateful to the National Science Foundation for supporting research which contributed to the first and second chapters of my dissertation.  Funding for the first chapter was provided through the NSF East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute Program.\\

My companions Petek and Aydin put up with a moody husband and father, many lonely dinners, and a pile of shoes making our foyer look like we were running a mosque.  Graduate school was an adventure, and I am grateful that they came along.
