\newthought{No graduate student} is an island.  I am deeply indebted to my adviser Jim Tybout for patience through countless meetings and my terrible whiteboard handwriting, for both giving me excellent advice and the freedom to make my own decisions, and for support of many kinds.  Straight is the gate and narrow is the way through graduate school, and I was lucky to have Jim as a guide.\\

I am grateful to Jonathan Eaton for his thorough comments on everything from barely coherent research notes up to my polished job-market paper, for his guidance in choosing a research topic, and for his general advice and training over the last five years.\\

My research has greatly benefitted from discussions with Kala Krishna, Ed Green, Paul Grieco, Steve Yeaple, Neil Wallace, Peter Newberry, Venky Venkateswaren, Mark Roberts, Russell Cooper, Michal Fabinger, and other Penn State faculty.\\

My understanding of economic research was tempered in the oven that is Kern 6th floor and over pitchers of beer at Cafe 210 West with my friends and colleagues Konstantin Kucheravyy, Yu Awaya, Bernardo Diaz de Astarloa, Gustavo Gudino, Ahmad Lashkaripoor, Farid Faroukki, Bulat Gafarov, Felix Tintelnot, Yelena Sheveleva, Yoske Igarashi, Xue Bai, Jicheng Liu, Shengyu Li, Bruno Salcado, Bruno Sultanum-Texiera, Alex Fakos, Gary Lyn, and many others.

My parents Mark and Ann Jinkins were generously willing to suffer through repeated fumbling descriptions of my ideas.  I hope they know how seriously I take their advice, and how they have shaped my life.\\

Finally to my companions Petek and Aydin, it has been an adventure.  Thanks for coming along with me.
