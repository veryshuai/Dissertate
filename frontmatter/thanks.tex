\newthought{No graduate student} is an island.  I am deeply indebted to my adviser Jim Tybout for patience with my terrible whiteboard handwriting in countless meetings, for both giving me excellent advice and the freedom to make my own decisions, and for support of several kinds.  Straight is the gate and narrow is the way through graduate school, and I was lucky to have Jim as a guide.\\

My parents Mark and Ann Jinkins were generous enough to continue calling me even after repeatedly suffering through fumbling descriptions of my \emph{next} great idea.  I hope they know how seriously I take their advice, and how they have shaped my life.\\
